# Vuesual VS Code Dark Theme

[![Version]()](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kaankucuk.vuesual#overview)


This Vue VS Code Theme is a personel theme. I thought, you can enjoy too. I am a daily developer, most of the time i get my hands dirty and open my IDE. By time i created this syntax highlighting for Vue components/directives etc.

I made it totally DARK and deep colors, so by time you will get to those colors and wont leave it ever. All other attributes are darker to chooce Vue-Html like a hawk ðŸ¦… .

I make updates frequently.

Hope you love it. <3
